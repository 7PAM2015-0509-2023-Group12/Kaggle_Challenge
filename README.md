# Predicting Spaceship Titanic passengers transport - Kaggle Challenge
# Objective 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify and predict the attributes of passengers along with their likelihood of getting transported to alternate dimensions.

# Method Statement:
The data was acquired that was sub-divided into Train and Test Dataset containing information about the passengers. After this, pre-processing of data was done that involved Data Cleaning to minimize the null values, Filling missing Values using Imputer, Feature Extraction, and Data Normalization. Machine Learning Models, Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and Stacking Classifier, were developed and trained on the pre-processed training data set. The trained model was evaluated on the test data set and hyper-parameters tuning using Grid Search or Random Search will be done to get the desired results. 
The final step was the selection of a model that can predict with better precision. The performances of developed models and their predictive ability was assessed using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Eventually, the superior model with best ability to classify and predict test data was finalized.
